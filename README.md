# Batocera PCSX2 custom-configs 

Script to save and automatically load separate configs for individual games on the PCSX2 emulator for Batocera Linux. 

# Installation
Simply copy the "pcsx2_custom_configs" folder to the root of the Batocera "SHARE" partition (along side the bios, roms, themes etc. directories). Thats it.

NOTE:  If you haven't set up and configured the PCSX2 settings on your Batocera installation already, do that before continuing with custom configs. 


# Configuring individual games

open the file manager (via the F1 key) and execute (usually by double clicking) the “start” file in the pcsx2_custom_configs directory.  (This will create a sub directory called ‘games’ and a sub directory structure within it containing separate configuration settings for each of your ps2 roms found in the roms directory.)

To change configurations on individual games, navigate via the Batocera’s file manager to the directory with the name of the game  eg: “pcsx2_custom_configs/games/Tekken 5.iso/” and execute the “pcsx2-custom-config” file in it to open the pcsx2 application. Changes in settings made here will not effect other games or the default pcsx2 settings in the system.
